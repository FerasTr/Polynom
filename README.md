*Polynom*

In this project you will find basic polynomial calculator.

**Getting Started**

This Project contains a general tester in the test folder as well as a graph
class in the Driver folder.

Examples:

*Monom positiveMonomString = new Monom("5.6\*x\^2")*

*Monom positiveM = new Monom(5.6, 2);*

*Polynom positiveP = new Polynom("5.6\*x\^3 + 35\*x\^2 + 5");*

To display a graph use:

*positiveP.display(-30, 30, 0.25);*

We used Wikipedia to learn the Riemann Integral

We used YouTube to learn the Bisection Method

We used stack overflow to learn about pointers and returning objects in java

Description
-----------

In the Monom class you will find the following methods: Add, Sub, multiply,
derivative, isValid, equals, function value at x.

In the Polynom class you will also find: root, area, derivative, add, sub,
equals, extreme points, isZero, function value at x.
